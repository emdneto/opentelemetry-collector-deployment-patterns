= Pattern #1 - Basic

This pattern features a scenario where clients are instrumented using OTLP, sending data to a cluster of collectors configured with a file similiar to `config.yaml` from this repository. To get this scenario working, you'll need to have a Jaeger instance running.

If you don't have a client readily available, you can use the https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/tracegen["tracegen"] utility to generate traces.
